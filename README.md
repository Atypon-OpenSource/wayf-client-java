# WAYF Cloud Java Client
The intent of this project is to wrap common integration touch points of the WAYF service in a Java client. This standardizes and abstracts away common tasks such as serialization and error handling for Java integrations.

For more information on the WAYF project, please visit it's [Github page](https://github.com/Atypon-OpenSource/wayf-cloud).
